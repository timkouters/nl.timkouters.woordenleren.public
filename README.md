# Privacy Policy – Woorden Leren

**Last updated: February 28, 2026**

✓ No data collected

## Introduction

Welcome to **Woorden Leren**. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles information when you use it. In short: the app collects no personal data, stores nothing, and contains no advertising.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information.** Woorden Leren does not require you to create an account, log in, or provide any personal details to use the app.

## Data Storage

Woorden Leren does not store any data on external servers or in the cloud. The app does not write any user data, preferences, or activity logs to your device beyond what the operating system itself manages for normal app operation (such as temporary cache).

## Third-Party Services

The app retrieves word content and images from **Wikipedia** solely to display them within the app. No personal or identifying information is sent to Wikipedia as part of these requests. The app also uses the device's built-in **text-to-speech** engine to pronounce words; this processing happens entirely on-device.

Woorden Leren does *not* integrate any of the following:

- Analytics or crash-reporting SDKs
- Advertising networks
- Social media trackers
- Marketing or retargeting tools

## Advertising

Woorden Leren contains **no advertisements** of any kind. No ad SDKs are included and no advertising identifiers are accessed.

## Children's Privacy

Woorden Leren is designed to be safe for users of all ages. Because the app collects no personal information whatsoever, it does not pose any privacy risk to children.

## Internet Permission

The app requires internet access solely to fetch word definitions and images from Wikipedia. No data originating from your device is transmitted to any server operated by the app developer.

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. Any changes will be published on this page with a revised "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can reach the developer at [ratejescheet@gmail.com](mailto:ratejescheet@gmail.com).
